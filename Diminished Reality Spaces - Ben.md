Emerging technologies increase distraction due to the high number of displaying surfaces and increased amounts of data around us. In our everyday lives, we encounter many distracting factors. Pointing out the relevance of attentive user interfaces (AUIs) by referring to the fact that our attention is a limited resource, Vertegaal [24] claims that we may better manage our attention by using technologies sensing, analyzing, and keeping track of our surroundings and ourselves. In this sense, AUIs are seen as systems tracking factors in the environment such as proximity, orientation, or verbal communication. Some of these studies follow a Diminished Reality (DR) approach for filtering out the information we receive before it reaches our sensory system. While most AUI solutions have been intended for HCI, recently it has also started to be addressed for human-human interaction (HHI) as well. These advances provide some playful and experimental novel opportunities for interaction design.

Diminished reality spaces, in contrast, aim to reduce the distracting visual incidents and continously changing surroundings which adversely affect individuals with [autism spectrum disorder (ASD)](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/facts.html).
