### SENG480C - A3 Personal Reflection

Throughout the process of collating research articles in an attempt to understand the augmentive systems they describe, I have grafted a substantial amount of knowledge into memory. I found that I would routinely place the assignment on the backburner, and become acutely focused on reading the articles and really gathering an understanding of some of the brilliant systems they were bringing awareness to. An article describing a mirror-like wall that diminished reality rather than augmenting it was particularly attention-grabbing. The concept of reducing the information load, particularly for those with unique perceptive structures such as individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, piqued my interest and was a novel concept. It was surprisingly intuitive for such a polar idea to what I have become familiar with; typically we add information and augment space with additional data rather than removing it. 

In terms of collating the data and constructing the assignment 'wiki', it was surprisingly difficult to coordinate all four of us and we typically conducted meetings with 3/4 of the group. The problem of scheduling is surprisingly complex, and the project meetings supported this principle. Despite this, we worked brilliantly when we did unite, and we would update each other routinely, which more than made up for the spotty meetings. I've really appreciated the ideas, and thinking of my group members, and have had a number of laughs with them all as we have become closer throughout the course of completing the assignment. This is a great assignment, and has gone swimmingly from my perspective.

On an additional note this assignment is the first that has effectively made me aware of the great resource that is the UVic library database. Historically, I have thought that everything I could possible need was available through the 'non-scholarly' side of Google, but this assignment has made me discover that these scholarly databases provide access to a heightened quality of articles that are difficult to find, or even impossible to find, through typical Google seaching. The time to search, also to my surprise, is much reduced with these databases. This is likely because far less filtering is needed; everything is of an excellent standard. It also provides sophisticated query methods that I have started to use more and more.
