# Attention affected by Environment
Environment has a substantial impact on our attention. The quantity and type of stimuli in an environment, the presence of nature, even entering digital environments through augmented or virtual reality. These all have a massive impact on various aspects of attention. Below is a list of the cognitive augmentation systems related to a person's environment that we researched, along with a brief description of each.

- [[Neuroscience approach to ADHD & improving focus]]: Improving focus with dopamine, 15min meditation, and reduced smartphone usage.
- [[Gamified Interaction with Virtual Nature]]: Using gamified virtual reality to increase attention restoration.
- [[Systems to capture student attention]]: Capture student attention by building a community in the classroom setting and facilitating signature attention activities.
- [[Diminished Reality Spaces]]: Reducing distracting stimuli for those diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder with the 'mirror' wall.
