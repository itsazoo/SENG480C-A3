# The 'Mirror' Wall

The ever-increasing emergence of technologies increases distraction. Increasing amounts of data, and an increasing number of devices to view it on, means we encounter distracting factors more often. [[Attentive User Interfaces]] have been an increasing relevant resource for mitigating the interferance of these distractions. A [Diminished Reality](https://www.marxentlabs.com/diminished-reality-ken-moser-explains-marxent/) approach can be used to filter out information before it is perceived by the our sensory systems. While these interfaces have primarily focused on [human-computer interaction](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/human-computer-interaction), they have begun exploring human-human interaction as well, where they are particularly applicable to individuals diagnosed with [autism spectrum disorder (ASD)](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/facts.html). This is in contrast to [augmented reality](https://www.fi.edu/what-is-augmented-reality) which aims to [[Directing Visual Attention with AR| direct users' visual attention]] by inducing visual information rather than reducing it.

Kunz et. al [have proposed such a system with a mirror-like, digital wall](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ezproxy.library.uvic.ca/document/7344759) which can filter out irrelevant information in a distracting environment as demonstrated in Figure 1 below. As individuals with ASD vary in terms of visual and auditory perception, and visual representation ability, the mirror-like wall proposed is interactive and focuses on the varied visual needs of ASD individuals.

The mirror-like wall is contructed within a space where information is projected onto surfaces and ojects in the 'mirror'. These are reflections of real objects within the room. Individual attention is augmented with the 'mirror' with the filtration of irrelevant information, and task guidance based on given sets of information. 

The 'mirror-wall' can (a) filter out extraneous objects by ASD individuals are affected, (b) reflect irrelevant objects to be portrayed as relevant, (c) reflect only needed objects, and (d) reflect only objects pertaining to a particular action or task. This reflective wall and its capabilities described above are depicted in Figure 2 below, and can be instantiated in numerous fashions as shown in Figure 3. These setups are particularly applicable to work environments to facilatate focus and attention towarld relevant information, and reduce distraction.

The mirror-like wall can also aid other's to establish proxemic boundaries for other individuals with ASD in a workplace. Social presence, limited physical distance, and physical interactions can be distracting for those with ASD, so to aid in this regard, the 'mirror' can define zones which depict the ASD individual's tolerance area in order to support, or block communication with others. This is illustrated in Figure 4.
