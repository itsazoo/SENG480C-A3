Attentive User Interfaces (AUI)

Researchers are becoming aware that user attention is a limited resource and it must be conserved. So modern devices and user interfaces structure their communication such that the limited resource of user attention is allocated optimally across the userâ€™s task. These types of UI's that are sensitive to a user's attention are called Attentive User Interfaces (AUIs). 

AUIs use statistical models to determine the priority of user requests and where to allocate attention. AUIs also need a way to determine what task the user is currently paying attention to. For this, they use various sensors and input channels that meausre characterisiticis of user's attention. These AUI systems can also augment a user's attention capacity. They do this by enhacning the information outputted via the channel that they know the user is the most attentive towards.

Where AUIs create a new paradigm for how devices can interact with users, they also bring new challenges for researches. Researchers from IBM are working on eye tracking, which is one of the most relevant indicator for attention tracking.
