To preserve the precious resource that is human attention, external devices and interfaces can be used to reduce the mental workload upon humans. These subtopics explore various systems that allow the valuable resource of attention to be used on more pressing matters and less so on laborious, repeating tasks. These systems include

1. [[Attentive User Intefaces - Mahum]]: Attentive User Interfaces are UI's which are sensitive to a user's attention and conserves it through statistical models.
2. [[Aware Brain Computer Interface - Annie]]: Vortmann and Putze propose an augmented reality system which includes the use of an EEG and eye tracking data to differentiate between external and internal states of user attention and providing appropriate prompts based on the user's attention state.
4. [[Designing for Augmented Attention - Connor]]: Outlining the attention problems with current GUIs and describing some example AUIs.
5. [[Directing Visual Attention with AR - Ben]]:
6. [[Diminished Reality Spaces - Ben]]:
7. [[Attention (Index) - All]]:
