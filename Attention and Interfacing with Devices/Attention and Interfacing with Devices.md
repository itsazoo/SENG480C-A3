# Attention and Interfacing with Devices
To preserve the precious resource that is human attention, external devices and interfaces can be used to reduce the mental workload upon humans. These subtopics explore various systems that allow the valuable resource of attention to be used on more pressing matters and less so on laborious, repeating tasks. These systems include:

- [[Attentive User Interfaces]]: Attentive User Interfaces are UI's which are sensitive to a user's attention and conserves it through statistical models.
- [[Aware Brain Computer Interface]]: Introducing a system in augmented realities that can differentiate between external and internal attention states of the user to help increase usability by decreasing distractions. 
- [[Designing Attentive User Interfaces]]: Outlining the attention problems with current GUIs and describing some example AUIs.
- [[Directing Visual Attention with AR]]: Using augmented reality to direct user attention more effectively and reduce the mental load on individuals.
- [[Diminished Reality Spaces]]: Reducing distracting stimuli for those diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder with the 'mirror' wall.
