Systems to capture student attention
[[Attention affected by Environment - All]]

Capturing students' attention is a struggle for teachers at any level of education. The lack of attention that pervades our society can toss blame on the booming tech industry and the introduction of smart phones. Research shows that even adults may develop ADHD because of the speed and abundance of context switching that exists in a smartphone. [[Neuroscience approach to ADHD & improving focus]]. Given the increasing population of smartphone users amongst students, attention is something that will only become increasingly harder to demand from them. 

Lang suggests that instead of trying to force students to keep attention in a class setting, teachers should adjust their class setting to naturally grab student attention. In his paper, Lang accounts one of the teachers he observed in his study was able to successfully grab her student's attention by building a community environment in her classroom setting. She did so by reciting each student by name when addressing them and having her students recite each other's names to form connections. In the morning she would follow up with her students lives as she set up her class activities. This engages students from the get go and she successfully captures her students willing attention. 

Lang introduces attention blindness that is common in a repetitive classroom setting. This occurs often during lectures where only the teacher would talk and the listening students would drift their attention and have low information retention. To solve this, Lang introduces signature attention activities. These activities will engage students to learn the material being taught by facilitating group settings where they can discuss with peers about their understanding of the material. These collaborative activities facilitate creativity and diverse perspectives.
